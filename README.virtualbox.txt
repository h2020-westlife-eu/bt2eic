#To create it please do the following:

vagrant up
# this takes several minutes

#If there are any issues, please check the logs by:
vagrant ssh -c 'cat /var/log/vboxadd-install.log'
vagrant ssh -c 'sudo journalctl -r'

#if this is the first time using this box and get an SSL error:
#download manually and install
curl -v -L -o centos.box -k  https://vagrantcloud.com/bento/boxes/centos-7.4/versions/201710.25.0/providers/virtualbox.box
vagrant box add bento/centos-7.2 centos.box

#Suspending and resuming the vagrantbox -----------------------------------

#After working, please stop the vagrant box session (don't forget to save any work!)
